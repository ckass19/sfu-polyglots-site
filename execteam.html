			<h2>Chris Kassner</h2>
			<h2>President</h2>
			<p><strong>Fluent: </strong>English, French, Japanese, Portuguese<br>
				<strong>Learning: </strong>Everything else<br>
				<strong>Why do you like learning languages? </strong><br> Growing up around different cultures I've always been interested in languages. Learning languages is fun and rewarding - it can open many doors professionally and lead to new friendships. I love traveling and adventures, so it's always fun speaking different languages with locals in different countries<br>
				<strong>Fun Fact: </strong>I lived in Tokyo for 5 years!

			<h2>Christina Lam</h2>
			<h2>VP Internal</h2>
			<p><strong>Fluent: </strong>English, French, Spanish<br>
				<strong>Learning: </strong>Mandarin, Esperanto<br>					
				<strong>Why do you like learning languages? </strong><br>I have been fascinated by languages for the longest time-- in Grade 1, I wanted to learn all the languages in the world! I think that it’s so valuable to be able to share words and cultures with others. This quote, usually attributed to Nelson Mandela, sums it up so well:  “If you talk to a [person] in a language [they] understand, that goes to [their] head. If you talk to [them] in [their] own language, that goes to [their] heart.”<br>
				<strong>Fun Fact: </strong>I’ve never tried coffee before!

			<h2>Athena Chan</h2>
			<h2>External VP/Artist</h2>
			<p><strong>Fluent: </strong>Cantonese, English, Mandarin<br>
				<strong>Learning: </strong>Japanese, Korean<br>	
				<strong>Why do you like learning languages? </strong><br>I love speaking in general so it will be nice if I can 
						talk to more people by knowing their language! Also, it’s super cool when I can spot similarities between Chinese (Canto/Mando), 
						Japanese and Korean. Another thing is that making multilingual puns are super fun heh :3<br>
				<strong>Fun Fact: </strong>My last name is 陳雅芬 and the pronounciation of the last character is 'fun' in Cantonese so I often make 'fun' puns!

			<h2>Anthony Or</h2>
			<h2>VP Finance</h2>
			<p><strong>Fluent: </strong>English, Cantonese<br>
				<strong>Learning: </strong>French, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Spanish<br>		
				<strong>Why do you like learning languages?</strong><br> Languages bring people together, and the learning of different cultures shows
						 respect to others from a different background. Languages are fun to learn, and can help you in your social, 
						 professional, and personal lives. Also, I got tired of people asking <em>"Are you not Chinese?"</em> when I told them I couldn’t speak Mandarin. <br>
				<strong>Fun Fact: </strong>I love investing in stocks, but I'm pretty bad it.  I end up checking the prices way too often without proper direction.

			<h2>VP Tech</h2>
			<p><strong>Fluent: </strong>English, Japanese<br>
				<strong>Learning: </strong>Russian, French, and other languages<br>
					
				<strong>Why do you like learning languages?</strong><br>I rarely interacted with foreign languages and cultures
						 until I was in my mid-teens. After I moved to Canada, I realized that human languages are so diverse and that knowing 
						 them is one of the keys to opening others' minds. It's not easy to acquire foreign languages, but the payoff is tremendous.<br>
				<strong>Fun Fact: </strong>I'm a big eater!

			<h2>Membership Chair</h2>
			<p><strong>Fluent: </strong>Cantonese, English, Mandarin<br>
				<strong>Learning: </strong>ASL, French, German, Korean<br>					
				<strong>Why do you like learning languages?</strong><br>I love traveling so it would be great if I can communicate 
						with the locals in their language. Also, looking at the subtitles while watching a movie/tv series is kind of distracting. 
						I hope I can understand what they are talking about without the help of subtitles! <br>
				<strong>Fun Fact: </strong>People think I'm from India because my name on Discord is "Jazman" but I'm actually from Hong Kong!

			<h2>Workshop Coordinator</h2>
			<p><strong>Fluent: </strong>Cebuano, English<br>
				<strong>Learning: </strong>Dutch, German, Korean, Tagalog<br>
				<strong>Why do you like learning languages?</strong><br> I like languages, as each one conveys emotions and speech in different ways. English is just a horrible language for conveying certain things in life, so knowing/learning other languages has helped me with that. <br>
				<strong>Fun Fact: </strong>My usual order at Starbucks is a grande upside down iced Americano with 6 shots and light ice.

			<h2>Brianna Condilenios</h2>
			<h2>Outreach Engagement Coordinator</h2>
			<p><strong>Fluent: </strong>English<br>
				<strong>Learning: </strong>Greek, French, Russian, Korean, and Vietnamese, but I plan on learning ALL languages<br>
				<strong>Why do you like learning languages?</strong><br> The world is precious. It is bursting with beautiful cultures, countries, people, and ways of life. Learning languages helps me begin to unlock some of that rich magnitude - even if it is from my bedroom. Speaking someone’s language can instantly communicate a level of cultural respect. Learning languages leads to people forming more meaningful connections with one another. Learning languages helps widen my world perspective and strengthen my mental capacities. I hope to maintain a lifestyle that is conscious of the wonderful diversity our world <br>
				<strong>Fun Fact: </strong>I was on a semester exchange in the Netherlands when COVID broke out in Spring 2020.  It was chaotic and frightening, but the experience has given me an invaluable perspective on the world, and taught me a lot about myself.  It's probably part of the reason I joined this club!

			<h2>Richard Nicolas</h2>
			<h2>VP Assistant</h2>
			<p><strong>Fluent: </strong> English, Tagalog<br>
				<strong>Learning: </strong>French, Korean<br>
				<strong>Why do you like learning languages?</strong><br>I find that language is like art. Each language has its own unique structure that connects people. I find that knowing more languages even if you’re not perfect immerses you in its culture. I was not fluent at Tagalog at first and couldn’t experience the full Filipino culture until I was able to go to school for it. After learning the language, I was able to experience the fullest extent of my culture. I discovered that knowing more languages would give me that benefit of discovering its culture. <br>
				<strong>Fun Fact: </strong>I've never been inside SFU Burnaby campus yet, but I bike up Burnaby mountain weekly in the summer!
